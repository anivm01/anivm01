### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer with a passion for crafting beautiful and functional applications. I first discovered my love for coding while living abroad in Japan, where I spent almost a decade as an ESL teacher. In between teaching sessions, I found myself tinkering with code, building websites and apps in my free time. It wasn't long before I realized that I had stumbled upon my true calling - to use my creativity, problem-solving skills, and love of technology to create meaningful solutions. Fast forward to today, and I'm thrilled to be pursuing a career in software development, with a particular focus on developing apps and tools that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. If you're looking for a collaborator who's passionate about creating amazing things with code, I'm your person!
